This website was detected as being HTML5
All of the tested pages appear to use semantic HTML. This is excellent.
None of the tested pages of this site use tables for layout. This is excellent, as using tables for layout is not necessary and they should only contain tabular data. A well built website should use div elements and CSS to create the desired layout.
